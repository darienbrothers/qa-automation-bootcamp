# ðŸ§ª Week 1 - Day 1: Python Basics

## âœ… What I Learned
- How to print to the console using `print()`
- How to create and store values in variables
- The 3 basic types I used:
  - `str` for text (strings)
  - `int` for numbers (integers)
  - `type()` function to check what type a variable is

## ðŸ›  Code Used
```python
print("Hello World")
name = "Darien"
experience_years = 5
print("Type:", type(name))


Takeaways
- Python is easy to read.
- Variables are dynamic â€” no need to define their type like other languages.
- This is the foundation for writing automation scripts that will interact with browsers later.
